# Inverse-kinematics-kuka-robot-using-ANN
This project uses Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) to solve the inverse kinematics of a KUKA robot arm. By training the ANN with forward kinematics data, it predicts joint angles for desired end-effector positions. This method provides fast, efficient, and accurate control for complex robotic movements.
